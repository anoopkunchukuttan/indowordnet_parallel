#  The IndoWordnet Parallel Corpus

_IndoWordnet_ is a linked structure of wordnets of major Indian languages from Indo-Aryan, Dravidian and Sino-Tibetan families. Synsets are linked across many languages. Every synset in every language contains a gloss and example usage sentence/phrase. In a large number of cases, the example and gloss sentences across languages are translations. Hence, IndoWordNet is a source of parallel corpora across multiple Indian languages. 

The corpus contains about 6.3 million parallel segments across 18 Indian languages from 3 languages families. 

**NEWS!** WMT 2020 is using this corpus for the [shared task on similar language translation](http://www.statmt.org/wmt20/similar.html)
